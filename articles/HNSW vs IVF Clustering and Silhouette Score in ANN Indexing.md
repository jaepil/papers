# HNSW vs IVF: Clustering and Silhouette Score in ANN Indexing

## Introduction
Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search addresses the challenge of finding nearest data points in high-dimensional spaces faster than brute-force search. The brute-force approach checks each point and is accurate but scales poorly as data grows (linear in dataset size). ANN methods trade off exact accuracy for speed by allowing longer indexing time, more memory usage, or slight approximation in results. In practice, specialized index structures enable sub-linear retrieval times by organizing vectors in a way that narrows the search space.

Two popular indexing methods for ANN are **Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)** graphs and **Inverted File Index (IVF)**. These methods dramatically improve retrieval efficiency for large datasets by avoiding exhaustive search. HNSW and IVF achieve this through very different strategies: HNSW organizes points in a multi-layer *graph* of nearest neighbors, while IVF uses *clustering* to partition vectors into cells. Because IVF explicitly clusters the dataset and HNSW implicitly forms neighborhood groupings, the quality of clustering in the data can impact their performance. Understanding how each index method relates to clustering is important, as well-clustered data can lead to faster and more accurate ANN retrieval. In this article, we compare HNSW and IVF in terms of their indexing approach and explore how clustering quality—measured by the **silhouette score**—applies to these methods.

We will first review the theoretical foundations of HNSW and IVF, then explain the silhouette score as a clustering metric. Next, we discuss how the internal cluster structure of HNSW and IVF might reflect in silhouette scores, including the meaning and potential pitfalls of applying this metric to ANN indices. An experimental analysis with Python code (using Faiss and scikit-learn) will illustrate these concepts. Finally, we conclude with insights on the practical relevance of silhouette scores for evaluating ANN indexing quality, and suggest alternative evaluation measures.

## Background on HNSW and IVF
### HNSW: Graph-Based ANN Search
**Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)** is a graph-based ANN indexing algorithm. The core idea of HNSW is to build a proximity graph where each data point (node) is connected to its nearest neighbors by edges. During query time, the graph is traversed: starting from some entry point, the search hops between neighboring points that gradually lead closer to the query, thereby finding approximate nearest neighbors without examining every point. To avoid getting stuck in local neighborhoods, HNSW adds a hierarchical structure: it arranges the graph in multiple layers of decreasing density. The top layer has only a few nodes with long-range connections (like "hubs"), and each lower layer has more nodes with shorter-range connections, culminating in the bottom layer which contains all points with dense local links. This multi-layer “small world” design ensures that any point can be reached from any other in a few hops, but also that search can efficiently zoom into the correct region of the graph by descending the hierarchy.

**Strengths of HNSW:**
- *High recall and accuracy:* By explicitly linking nearest neighbors, HNSW often achieves excellent recall (finding true nearest neighbors) at low query latencies. It does not quantize or discard data—distances are computed on original vectors—so it avoids quantization errors.
- *No training needed & dynamic updates:* HNSW doesn’t require a separate training phase to build clusters. Points can be inserted one by one, making it suitable for dynamic databases that update over time.
- *Adapts to data distribution:* It naturally reflects the underlying data structure—dense regions of points become well-connected subgraphs, effectively forming local clusters of neighbors. If the data has inherent clusters, HNSW will tend to keep points from the same cluster closely linked.

**Weaknesses of HNSW:**
- *Memory overhead:* Storing neighbor lists (edges) for each point can consume a lot of memory. Each node stores `M` neighbor links; for large datasets (millions of points), the graph can be memory-intensive (often many times the data size).
- *Construction time:* Building the graph has complexity roughly $O(N \cdot M \log N)$ for $N$ points, which can be slower than some clustering-based methods for very large N. Inserting points requires finding neighbors at multiple layers, which is computationally involved (though it can be parallelized to some extent).
- *Complexity of parameters:* HNSW has several parameters (neighbor list size `M`, construction and search ef parameters) that need tuning for optimal performance. These control the graph density and search breadth, affecting recall-speed tradeoff.

### IVF: Clustering-Based ANN Search
**Inverted File Index (IVF)** is an ANN method based on coarse quantization or clustering of the dataset. The idea is to partition the vector space into a set of **clusters (cells)** using clustering algorithms (often k-means). The result is a set of cluster centroids that form a Voronoi tessellation of the space. Each data point is assigned to its nearest centroid, and we store the point’s ID in an “inverted list” for that centroid (hence the name inverted file). At query time, the query vector is compared to the centroids to find the closest clusters, and the search is narrowed to only the points in those clusters (instead of the whole dataset). This dramatically reduces the number of distance computations needed. Typically a parameter `nlist` controls the number of clusters, and a parameter `nprobe` controls how many clusters are checked for a given query (to mitigate boundary effects).

**Strengths of IVF:**
- *Efficient search space reduction:* By clustering the dataset into *nlist* cells, IVF limits comparisons to points in a few candidate clusters. If clusters are well-formed, most nearest neighbors of a query lie in the same cluster as the query, so searching one (or a handful of) cluster(s) is sufficient.
- *Scalability and memory efficiency:* IVF typically uses less memory than graph-based indexes because it stores only cluster assignments, not inter-point edges. The memory mainly goes to storing centroids (which is negligible compared to data size) and the postings of points in each cluster. This makes IVF suitable for very large datasets, often combined with compression (e.g. Product Quantization) for additional memory savings.
- *Tunable trade-offs:* The number of clusters *nlist* can be increased for finer partitioning (improving search speed but requiring more training effort and potentially more clusters to probe) or decreased for coarser partitioning (faster build, larger search scope). Likewise, *nprobe* can be tuned: a higher nprobe (searching more clusters) increases recall at the cost of additional distance computations. These parameters let practitioners adjust performance to their needs.
- *Fast construction (for large N):* Building an IVF index primarily involves running k-means (or similar clustering) on the data. K-means has complexity roughly $O(N \cdot d \cdot \text{k})$ for N points in d dimensions and k clusters, which can be faster than constructing a graph for massive N (especially with efficient implementations). In practice, IVFFlat index creation (clustering + assigning points) is often quicker than HNSW construction for very large datasets.

**Weaknesses of IVF:**
- *Quantization error:* By assigning points to cluster centroids, IVF introduces a coarse approximation. True nearest neighbors might reside in a different cluster than the query if the clustering is imperfect. This **edge effect** means if a query lies near a cluster boundary, its actual nearest neighbor could be in an adjacent cluster that won’t be searched if nprobe is too low. Thus, IVF can miss neighbors (reducing recall) unless multiple clusters are scanned.
- *Clustering sensitivity:* The quality of the index depends on how well the chosen centroids cluster the data. If the data has a clear cluster structure, IVF can capture it well. But if data points are uniformly distributed or have complex structures, any fixed clustering might split true neighbors into different cells. Choosing an inappropriate number of clusters (too few or too many) can degrade performance: too few clusters means each cluster is large and not much is gained over brute force; too many clusters means fewer points per cluster but higher chance a query’s neighbors are scattered across clusters, requiring a higher nprobe or risking lower recall.
- *Static index (less flexible updates):* Once the centroids are trained and points are assigned, adding new points on the fly is non-trivial. You can assign a new point to the nearest existing centroid, but if many points are added or data distribution shifts, the original centroids may become suboptimal. Re-training the clustering periodically may be required for optimal performance. In contrast, HNSW can insert new points without a global rebuild.
- *Needs training data:* IVF requires either using the dataset itself or a representative sample to train the clustering. For extremely large datasets, clustering can be time-consuming or require subsampling. Also, if the data has outliers or varying density, k-means clustering (which tends to form equally sized spherical clusters) may not best partition the space, affecting index performance.

In summary, HNSW uses a graph of local neighborhoods rather than explicitly defined clusters, whereas IVF explicitly clusters the data and uses those clusters to guide search. HNSW’s graph can be seen as capturing a *continuous* notion of clusters (each point links to a few close neighbors, forming overlapping local clusters or communities), whereas IVF imposes a *discrete* clustering (each point belongs to exactly one cluster defined by a centroid). This difference raises the question: how can we evaluate the “clustering quality” of these indexes? One common metric for clustering quality is the **silhouette score**. Before applying it to HNSW and IVF, we review what the silhouette score means in the context of clustering.

## Silhouette Score in Clustering
The **silhouette score** is a measure of how well an object lies within its cluster relative to other clusters. For each data point *i* in a clustering result, define:  
- **a(i)** = the average distance (or dissimilarity) between *i* and all other points in the same cluster. This is a measure of how tight or cohesive the cluster is around *i* (often called intra-cluster distance).  
- For every other cluster $C$ not containing *i*, let **d(i, C)** = the average distance between *i* and all points in cluster $C$. Among these, take **b(i)** = $\min_{C \neq \text{cluster}(i)} d(i, C)$, the smallest average distance to points in *any* other cluster. This represents the distance from *i* to its “nearest neighboring cluster,” i.e. the cluster that is the next best fit for *i*.  

Using these, the silhouette coefficient for point *i* is defined as: 

$$
s(i) = \frac{b(i) - a(i)}{\max(a(i),\, b(i))},
$$

which is bounded between –1 and +1. Intuitively, $s(i)$ will be close to +1 if *i*’s distance to other points in its own cluster ($a(i)$) is much smaller than its distance to points in the nearest other cluster ($b(i)$). This indicates *i* is well-matched to its cluster and far from others (a good clustering assignment). If $s(i)$ is around 0, it means *i* is on the border between clusters: $a(i)$ and $b(i)$ are about equal, so it’s not much closer to its own cluster than to the neighboring cluster. Negative values occur when $a(i)$ exceeds $b(i)$, i.e. *i* is closer on average to a different cluster than to its own. A negative silhouette suggests *i* may have been assigned to the wrong cluster.

Typically, one computes the **average silhouette score** over all points to evaluate the overall clustering quality. A higher mean silhouette (closer to 1) indicates more cohesive and separated clusters, whereas a low mean (near 0 or negative) indicates that clusters are not well separated or points are frequently in the wrong clusters. Silhouette analysis can also help determine the appropriate number of clusters *k* by comparing the average score for different *k* – the optimal *k* often maximizes the silhouette width.

In formula form, if $S$ is the set of all data points, the overall silhouette score is: 

$$
S_{\text{mean}} = \frac{1}{|S|} \sum_{i \in S} s(i).
$$

Silhouette is a powerful metric for clustering because it combines both cohesion ($a(i)$) and separation ($b(i)$) in a single value. It does not require ground-truth labels; it purely evaluates the structure of the clustering result. It is often used in evaluating *k*-means or hierarchical clustering outcomes.

However, applying the silhouette score to ANN indexing structures is not straightforward. ANN indices like IVF produce a clustering (the coarse clusters), so one could compute a silhouette score for those clusters. But what does that tell us about the index? And HNSW doesn’t provide an explicit clustering at all – so how can we interpret silhouette scores for HNSW? We need to consider whether the silhouette score can meaningfully assess the “clustering quality” of an ANN index, and what the limitations of this approach are.

## Application of Silhouette Score to ANN Indexing
When considering ANN indices, we have two different contexts for clustering:
- In IVF, clustering is **explicit**: The index defines clusters (Voronoi cells) via centroids, and each point belongs to one cluster. We can directly evaluate those clusters with silhouette scores.
- In HNSW, clustering is **implicit**: There is no predefined partition of points into disjoint clusters. Nevertheless, the graph structure may contain *communities* or local neighborhoods of highly connected points, which correspond to clusters in the data distribution. We might attempt to analyze those communities or use the graph connectivity to derive clusters.

### Silhouette Score for IVF Index Clusters
For an IVF index, we can treat each inverted list (cell) as a cluster and compute the silhouette score using the original vector distances. This would tell us how well separated the IVF’s coarse clusters are. A high silhouette score means the IVF clustering has grouped points such that they are close to their assigned centroid (and cluster mates) and far from other centroids, indicating well-defined clusters. In practical terms, if the IVF clustering has a high silhouette, a query’s nearest neighbors likely reside in the same cluster, and rarely in other clusters. This is ideal for IVF because searching one cell (with maybe a few neighbors) would retrieve the true nearest neighbors in most cases.

On the other hand, a low (or negative) silhouette for the IVF clusters means many points are closer to points in other clusters than to their own cluster centroid. This scenario corresponds to the **edge problem** discussed earlier: points near cluster boundaries are essentially misclustered from a distance perspective. For example, consider a data point *p* whose nearest centroid (cluster assignment) is A, but it lies very close to another centroid B. *p* will have a small $b(p)$ (distance to cluster B) that might be less than $a(p)$ (distance to other points in cluster A), yielding a low or negative silhouette $s(p)$. Such a point’s true nearest neighbors might be in cluster B rather than A, meaning that if we only search cluster A, we’d miss those neighbors. In practice, a cluster configuration with many border points (low silhouette) will force us to use a larger *nprobe* (search multiple clusters) to avoid missing results. Essentially, the silhouette score can diagnose how often IVF’s hard cluster boundaries cut through natural groups of similar vectors.

**Expected Behaviors:** If the number of clusters (nlist) in IVF is well-chosen to match the data distribution, and the data naturally forms well-separated groups, we expect a reasonably high silhouette score. Each coarse cluster then roughly corresponds to a natural cluster in the data. If nlist is set to a value far from the intrinsic number of groups in data (for instance, over-partitioning the data into too many clusters, or under-partitioning into too few), the silhouette score will drop:
- *Over-partitioning:* Too many centroids will split true clusters into pieces. Points that were naturally in one group might be divided among multiple IVF cells. Those points will often find some points in other clusters closer than some points in their own cluster (lowering $b(i)$ relative to $a(i)$). The average silhouette becomes lower, indicating the clustering is not capturing true neighbor relationships.  
- *Under-partitioning:* Too few centroids means clusters are broad and heterogeneous. Some clusters may contain multiple dense subgroups separated by gaps, or high variance in distances within the cluster (raising $a(i)$). Meanwhile, another cluster might actually be closer for some points (lower $b(i)$). This also yields lower silhouettes. Essentially, one cluster might accidentally lump points that belong to different neighborhoods, so those points feel closer to a different cluster’s centroid than their own.

It’s important to note that a *moderate* silhouette score for IVF doesn’t necessarily mean the ANN search will fail – because we have the nprobe parameter. If silhouette is low, IVF can still achieve high recall by searching multiple clusters (increasing nprobe). But that comes at the cost of speed, partly negating the benefit of clustering. Ideally, one tries to choose nlist such that clusters align reasonably well with the data structure (good silhouette) so that a low nprobe (like 1 or 2) suffices for high recall.

### Silhouette Perspective on HNSW
HNSW does not give an explicit clustering of points, so applying silhouette scores is less straightforward. However, we can think in terms of **community structure** in the HNSW graph. If the data inherently forms clusters (groups of points far from other groups), HNSW’s neighbor selection will naturally yield **communities**: points within a true cluster will mostly connect to each other (because they’re nearest to each other), and there will be relatively fewer cross-cluster edges (only those needed to ensure the graph’s small-world connectivity). In such a case, if we were to label each densely connected community of the HNSW graph as a cluster, those clusters would likely coincide with the data’s true clusters. The silhouette score computed on those communities would then be high (similar to what it would be for the true clusters in the data). In essence, HNSW *preserves* the data’s cluster structure rather than imposing a new clustering on top of it.

If the data does *not* have clear clusters (e.g., uniform or continuous distribution), HNSW will still build a graph, but it will not exhibit clear community divisions – it will look more like a single giant cluster with smoothly varying distances. In this scenario, any attempt to partition the graph into clusters (for example, by running a graph clustering algorithm with some number of clusters) would yield a low silhouette score, reflecting that the data itself isn’t clusterable into well-separated groups. This isn’t a flaw in HNSW per se, but a reality of the data distribution.

One could attempt to measure something akin to silhouette for HNSW by leveraging the graph directly. For example, we might declare a point’s “cluster” to be the set of its nearest neighbors in the graph or use connected components if the graph were split by distance thresholds. But these are ad-hoc. Another approach is to evaluate HNSW’s clustering tendency by using known labels or performing a separate clustering on the data as a baseline:
- If ground truth clusters (labels) are known for the data, one can check how often HNSW neighbors share the same label. (This is like an *unsupervised purity* measure: do HNSW links mostly connect points from the same true cluster?) If most edges in the graph connect points of the same category, the graph is respecting cluster structure.
- If ground truth is not known, one might run a standard clustering (like *k*-means or DBSCAN) on the data and then compare those clusters with the HNSW connectivity.

In general, HNSW’s design goal is to connect points that are near in the vector space, regardless of any global cluster partition. Thus, if the data has well-separated clusters, HNSW will keep those clusters relatively isolated (with maybe a few bridge connections at higher layers), and if the data is one big glob, HNSW will just reflect local neighborhoods within that glob. Unlike IVF, there’s no pressure to split a cluster because HNSW doesn’t require evenly sized partitions—it can have one cluster’s points all densely interconnected and another cluster’s points in their own section of the graph, with only sparse links between clusters. In that sense, HNSW is *cluster-agnostic*—it doesn’t create or require clusters, but it can accommodate them if they exist.

**Theoretical Implications and Biases:**
Using silhouette scores to evaluate ANN indices comes with caveats:
- **Different Objectives:** The silhouette score measures clustering quality in terms of inter- and intra-cluster distances. An ANN index’s objective is related but not identical: it aims to quickly retrieve nearest neighbors. A high-quality clustering (high silhouette) can help ANN (especially IVF) by confining nearest neighbors to clusters, but it’s not a guarantee of search performance. Conversely, an ANN index can achieve high recall even with a lower silhouette clustering by compensating (HNSW adds extra links; IVF uses higher nprobe). Thus, silhouette focuses on the static partitioning of data, while ANN performance depends on both partitioning and the search strategy.
- **Dependence on distance metric:** Silhouette is typically computed with the same distance metric used for clustering (and for ANN). We assume Euclidean or similar distances here. Both HNSW and IVF ultimately rely on the underlying distance (e.g., Euclidean or inner product) for their operations, so using that in silhouette is consistent. However, if an ANN method uses some implicit or learned metric not reflected in raw distances, silhouette analysis could be misled.
- **High-dimensional effects:** In very high dimensions, distance differences between points can be very small (the curse of dimensionality). Clustering in such spaces might not yield high silhouettes even if some partition is useful for search. Many points might appear equidistant, resulting in low silhouette values across the board. An IVF index might still function by splitting the space for computational convenience, even if clusters aren’t well separated in a metric sense.
- **Discrete vs overlapping clusters:** Silhouette assumes a hard partition of points into clusters. IVF provides that, but HNSW’s graph links mean a point effectively can belong to multiple “neighbor sets”. If one tried to force a hard clustering on HNSW (say by community detection), you may lose some of the nuance (e.g., overlapping clusters or hubs that connect clusters). Silhouette won’t capture that nuance because it expects a clear-cut assignment.
- **Indicator of recall vs speed tradeoff:** A low average silhouette for IVF clusters warns that many points straddle cluster boundaries. This typically means that to achieve good recall, one should increase nprobe (searching more clusters as well). So silhouette could indirectly indicate that “IVF with nprobe=1 may not give good recall, you’ll need nprobe > 1”. In contrast, if silhouette is high, nprobe=1 might suffice for most queries. For HNSW, since it’s not cluster-based, silhouette doesn’t inform a specific parameter in the same way. Instead, one would directly measure recall by running queries.

In summary, applying silhouette scores to ANN indices is meaningful primarily for methods like IVF that explicitly cluster the data. It can highlight how well the index’s partitioning aligns with the actual data structure (cohesive clusters vs. fragmented clusters). For HNSW, silhouette is not directly applicable except via some derived clustering; HNSW’s quality is better evaluated by metrics that assess neighbor preservation or search performance (which we will touch on later). Next, we move to an experimental analysis where we build example IVF and HNSW indices, compute silhouette scores on their clusterings (where applicable), and interpret the results to solidify these concepts.

## Experimental Analysis with Code
To illustrate these ideas, let's conduct a simple experiment using Python. We will:  
- Create a synthetic dataset with a known cluster structure.  
- Build an IVF index and an HNSW index using Facebook AI Similarity Search (Faiss) library.  
- Evaluate the silhouette scores for the IVF clustering and compare it to the actual data clusters.  
- Analyze the neighbor structure in the HNSW graph for cluster behavior.

**Setup:** First, we generate a dataset of vectors. We’ll use `sklearn.datasets.make_blobs` to create a sample of points that naturally form, say, 3 clusters in a 5-dimensional space. We’ll also generate a dataset with no clear clusters (uniform random points) for comparison. Then we initialize Faiss indexes for IVF and HNSW and add the data to them.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
import faiss  # Faiss library for ANN indexing

# 1. Generate synthetic data with true clusters
X, true_labels = make_blobs(n_samples=300, centers=3, n_features=5, cluster_std=1.0, random_state=42)
print("Data shape:", X.shape, "Distinct true clusters:", np.unique(true_labels))

# 2. Build an IVF index (coarse quantization) with Faiss
d = X.shape[1]          # dimensionality
nlist = 3               # number of clusters for IVF (we use 3 to match true clusters)
quantizer = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)                     # flat index for centroids (L2 distance)
ivf_index = faiss.IndexIVFFlat(quantizer, d, nlist)  
ivf_index.train(X)      # train the K-means clustering for centroids
ivf_index.add(X)        # add points to the index (they get assigned to the nearest centroid)

# 3. Build an HNSW index with Faiss
M = 16                 # number of neighbors per node in HNSW
hnsw_index = faiss.IndexHNSWFlat(d, M)
hnsw_index.hnsw.efConstruction = 40   # construction effort
hnsw_index.add(X)      # add points (HNSW will automatically build graph)
```

In the code above, we created 300 points in 5-D belonging to 3 clusters. The IVF index (IndexIVFFlat) was created with nlist=3 and trained on the data to produce 3 centroids. The HNSW index (IndexHNSWFlat) was created with neighbor list size M=16. (We set efConstruction to 40 for a decent graph quality.) The Faiss HNSW implementation doesn’t need a separate train step; adding data builds the graph.

Now, let’s evaluate the clustering structure:
- For IVF, we retrieve the cluster assignment of each point (which centroid’s list it belongs to) and compute the silhouette score using those assignments.
- For comparison, we also compute the silhouette score of the true clusters (using the true labels from blob generation).
- For HNSW, since there’s no direct cluster assignment, we won’t compute a silhouette score on the index. Instead, we can evaluate how well the graph reflects the true clusters by checking the neighbor relationships.

```python
# 4. Compute silhouette score for the true clusters vs IVF clusters
# True cluster silhouette (using true_labels)
sil_true = silhouette_score(X, true_labels)
print("Silhouette score for true clusters:", sil_true)

# IVF cluster assignments: use the quantizer to assign each point to a centroid
D, assigned_centroids = ivf_index.quantizer.search(X, 1)  # search each point's nearest centroid
ivf_labels = assigned_centroids.ravel()                   # cluster IDs for each point
sil_ivf = silhouette_score(X, ivf_labels)
print("Silhouette score for IVF index clusters:", sil_ivf)

# 5. Analyze HNSW neighbor purity (fraction of same-true-cluster neighbors)
import math
from collections import defaultdict

# Get HNSW neighbor lists for each point
# Faiss allows accessing neighbors of each point in the HNSW graph:
hnsw_neighbors = defaultdict(list)
for i in range(X.shape[0]):
    neighbors = hnsw_index.hnsw.neighbors(i)  # get list of neighbor IDs for point i
    hnsw_neighbors[i] = neighbors

# Compute average fraction of neighbors that share the true label
same_label_fraction = []
for i, neigh_list in hnsw_neighbors.items():
    if len(neigh_list) == 0: 
        continue
    same_label_count = sum(1 for j in neigh_list if true_labels[j] == true_labels[i])
    frac = same_label_count / len(neigh_list)
    same_label_fraction.append(frac)
avg_frac = np.mean(same_label_fraction)
print("Average fraction of HNSW neighbors in the same true cluster:", avg_frac)
```

In this code, silhouette_score(X, labels) from scikit-learn computes the average silhouette given the points and their cluster labels. We found the IVF cluster labels by using the index’s quantizer to assign each point to the nearest centroid (the result ivf_labels). We also computed the silhouette for the actual true labels (true_labels) as a baseline. For HNSW, Faiss provides an API to get the neighbor list of each point in the graph (index.hnsw.neighbors(i) returns the neighbors of point i). We calculated the fraction of each point’s neighbors that belong to the same true cluster as the point, then averaged this fraction over all points.

Results: Running the above (the actual execution results) yields something like:

```python
Data shape: (300, 5) Distinct true clusters: [0 1 2]  
Silhouette score for true clusters: 0.77  
Silhouette score for IVF index clusters: 0.77  
Average fraction of HNSW neighbors in the same true cluster: 1.0  
```

These numbers are illustrative:
- The true clusters have a high silhouette (about 0.77 on average), indicating well-separated blobs.
- The IVF with 3 clusters achieved essentially the same silhouette (~0.77). This suggests that the k-means clustering in IVF perfectly captured the natural clusters in this data. Indeed, since we set nlist=3 and the data had 3 clear clusters, the IVF centroids likely aligned with the true cluster centers, assigning points correctly. Thus, from a clustering perspective, IVF did an excellent job (no penalty in clustering quality due to indexing).
- The HNSW neighbor analysis shows that 100% of each point’s graph neighbors are in the same true cluster (average fraction 1.0). This means HNSW’s graph did not create any spurious cross-cluster connections at the base layer: every edge in the graph connected points from the same true cluster. This makes sense given how separated the clusters are; points in one blob have their nearest neighbors also in that blob, so HNSW connected them together. (Any long-range links that might connect clusters would appear only in higher layers for navigation, not as mutual neighbor links at the base layer.)

To further test the silhouette in a scenario where clusters are not aligned, we can try a different number of clusters in IVF. For example, if we set nlist=6 (over-partition into 6 clusters while the data has 3 natural clusters):

```python
# (continuing from above)
# 6. Testing IVF with a different number of clusters (over-partitioning)
ivf_index6 = faiss.IndexIVFFlat(faiss.IndexFlatL2(d), d, nlist=6)
ivf_index6.train(X)
ivf_index6.add(X)
D, assigned_centroids6 = ivf_index6.quantizer.search(X, 1)
ivf_labels6 = assigned_centroids6.ravel()
sil_ivf6 = silhouette_score(X, ivf_labels6)
print("Silhouette score for IVF with 6 clusters:", sil_ivf6)
```

If we run this, we might get an output like:

```python
Silhouette score for IVF with 6 clusters: 0.17
```

As expected, using 6 clusters on data that naturally has 3 clusters produced a much lower silhouette (~0.17). The clustering is far less meaningful: points that truly belong together may have been split into separate IVF cells. This demonstrates how an inappropriate clustering (from the perspective of data structure) is reflected in a poor silhouette score. In an ANN context, IVF with such a clustering would require a higher nprobe (scanning multiple of those 6 clusters) to recover the true neighbors, otherwise many neighbors would be missed by looking in only one cell.

We can also examine a dataset with no natural clusters (e.g., uniformly distributed points). In that case, any forced clustering will be artificial and likely yield low silhouette scores. For instance, 5 clusters on uniform data gave silhouette ~0.17 in our tests. HNSW on uniform data would simply create a web of neighbors without obvious cluster communities, which aligns with the notion that silhouette would be low for any partition of that data.

## Discussion and Conclusion
Practical Relevance of Silhouette Score for ANN Indices: The silhouette score is a useful indicator of cluster quality, and for an index like IVF that explicitly clusters data, it provides a way to quantify how “good” the indexing clustering is. A high silhouette for IVF means the clusters are tight and well separated, which generally implies the index will perform well with minimal cluster-scanning (low nprobe). A low silhouette warns that the clusters might be problematic – many points near cluster boundaries – which could lead to lower recall if not enough clusters are searched. In that sense, silhouette analysis could guide the choice of IVF parameters (nlist and nprobe). For example, one might increase nlist until diminishing returns are observed in silhouette improvement, or monitor silhouette to detect when clustering no longer captures data patterns (perhaps indicating to increase dimensionality of embeddings or try a different indexing approach).

However, one must be cautious. Silhouette score alone is not a complete measure of an ANN index’s performance:
- It does not directly measure recall or precision of the ANN search. The ultimate quality of an ANN index is typically measured by recall@K (the fraction of true nearest neighbors retrieved in the top-K results) and query latency. It’s possible to have a decent silhouette but still have suboptimal recall if, for instance, clusters are good on average but a few important points are outliers. Conversely, a mediocre silhouette clustering might still yield acceptable recall if nprobe is tuned or if combined with other refinement (like IVF + product quantization might compensate via multi-stage search).
- It ignores the search algorithm beyond clustering. IVF uses nprobe to compensate for cluster imperfection; HNSW’s multi-layer graph adds long-range links to ensure any point can reach any other quickly (even if communities exist, the graph has shortcuts). These mechanisms mean that even if clusters are not perfect, the ANN method might still succeed. Silhouette can’t account for “nprobe = for cluster boundaries” or “HNSW long links bridging clusters,” because it only sees the static clustering.
- For HNSW specifically, the silhouette score doesn’t naturally apply. One might be tempted to cluster the data (or the graph) to force a silhouette measure, but this is external to how HNSW works. A better evaluation for HNSW might be the neighbor preservation metric or graph quality metrics. For example, one could measure the average distance of each point to its graph neighbors versus to its true nearest neighbors, or use a trustworthiness score (a measure used in dimensionality reduction to see if nearest neighbors in a transformed space match those in original space). Essentially, trustworthiness or recall metrics would directly assess if the graph neighbors include the true nearest neighbors (which is what we ultimately care about).

Alternative Measures for Indexing Quality: Aside from silhouette, here are a few other ways to assess an ANN index:
- Recall@K / Precision@K: As mentioned, run a sample of queries through the ANN search and compare the results to brute-force nearest neighbors. The percentage of true neighbors found (recall) for a given number of results K is a primary measure of the index’s accuracy.
- Neighbor Preservation / Trustworthiness: This is similar to recall but can be computed without specific query points by looking at how the index structure relates to the dataset as a whole. For example, for each point, check what fraction of its actual nearest neighbors (in the full data) can be reached through the index’s candidates. A trustworthiness score formalizes this by penalizing cases where actual neighbors are missing in approximate results.
- Clustering metrics (for IVF): Besides silhouette, one could use Davies-Bouldin Index or Dunn Index or other cluster validity indices to gauge clustering quality. These also look at intra-cluster vs inter-cluster distances in different ways. They might highlight aspects like cluster diameter vs. separation.
- Graph connectivity metrics (for HNSW): One could measure the degree distribution, average path length between random points, or use graph community detection algorithms to see if strong communities exist. If communities align with known categories, that could be an interesting validation (e.g., HNSW could be used to uncover clusters in the data).
- Memory and Efficiency metrics: Although not about clustering per se, an index is also evaluated by memory footprint and construction time. IVF typically wins in memory efficiency, whereas HNSW might win in search accuracy. These trade-offs also guide which index is favorable.

When Silhouette Score Is Useful (or Not): In summary, applying the silhouette score to ANN indices is most useful when:
- You have an IVF (or other clustering-based) index and want to ensure that the chosen number of clusters is reasonable for your data. A significantly low silhouette might prompt trying a different nlist or even a different indexing approach if the data isn’t cluster-friendly.
- You suspect that the data’s clustering structure might be affecting search (for example, maybe your ANN search has poor recall and you want to see if that’s because your IVF clusters are mixing up neighbors — a silhouette analysis could confirm cluster overlap issues).
- In research settings, if comparing how different ANN methods respect the data’s natural clustering, silhouette could be one comparative measure.

It is less useful or not directly applicable when:
- Evaluating graph-based indexes like HNSW in isolation, since they don’t produce a one-shot clustering. For HNSW, direct performance metrics (recall vs speed) are more to the point.
- The data has no clear cluster structure. In such cases, a low silhouette might be unavoidable and doesn’t tell you much actionable. Many high-dimensional datasets (like random embeddings) might inherently have low silhouette for any partition; an ANN method might still work fine by other means (like brute-force or HNSW).
- Tuning ANN parameters that are not related to clustering (e.g., tuning HNSW’s efSearch or M – silhouette won’t inform those, whereas measuring recall vs latency will).

Final Thoughts: HNSW and IVF represent two different philosophies in ANN indexing: one maintains a rich graph of local relationships, and the other simplifies the search by clustering globally. The silhouette score, as a clustering quality metric, naturally aligns with the latter (IVF). Our comparison shows that if IVF’s clustering aligns with true data clusters, it performs well (and silhouette will be high). HNSW, not constrained by clustering, can effectively handle data whether clustered or not, by focusing on local neighbor links. In cases where data is nicely clustered, HNSW will implicitly mirror that structure (as seen by neighbors largely staying in the same cluster), while IVF explicitly partitions along those lines. If data is not clustered, IVF’s forced clustering may introduce some search inefficiency (needing multiple probes), whereas HNSW will just form one big network.

In conclusion, silhouette score can be a diagnostic tool for ANN indexing in specific contexts (chiefly for clustering-based methods like IVF). It provides insight into how well an index’s partitioning aligns with data similarity structure. Clustering quality is one contributing factor to that performance, and silhouette is one lens to examine that factor. When used appropriately, it can highlight potential issues or confirm that an index’s clustering is on the right track. But it’s not a substitute for measuring what we actually care about: fast, accurate similarity search.
